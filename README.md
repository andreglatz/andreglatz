I'm passionate about technology and the impact it has on people's lives. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I currently work with web development, but as a hobby, I like to study about low level programming and computer architecture. Besides that, I'm like learn about infrastructure and cloud computing.
